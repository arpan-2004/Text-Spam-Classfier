This project presents a simple yet effective SMS Spam Classifier built using the Naive Bayes algorithm, a popular probabilistic model commonly used in text classification tasks. The primary objective is to automatically distinguish between spam and ham (legitimate) SMS messages using Natural Language Processing techniques and machine learning.

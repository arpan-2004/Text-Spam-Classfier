# Text-Spam-Classfier
This project presents a simple yet effective SMS Spam Classifier built using the Naive Bayes algorithm, a popular probabilistic model commonly used in text classification tasks. The primary objective is to automatically distinguish between spam and ham (legitimate) SMS messages using Natural Language Processing techniques and machine learning.

 Key Features
Utilizes Multinomial Naive Bayes, ideal for text classification tasks

Preprocessing includes text normalization, tokenization, stop word removal, and vectorization using TF-IDF

Achieves high accuracy and precision on benchmark SMS datasets

Easy-to-understand codebase suitable for beginners in machine learning and NLP

 Project Structure
data/ - Contains the SMS Spam Collection dataset

notebooks/ - Jupyter notebooks with EDA, preprocessing, and model training

src/ - Python scripts for model training and prediction

app/ - (Optional) Flask or Streamlit web app for live testing
